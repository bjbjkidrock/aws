# Security in the Cloud

## Shared Responsibility Model
While AWS manages security _of the cloud_, security _in the cloud_ is the responsibility of the customer.

Customers retain control of what security they choose to implement to protect their own content, platform, applications, systems and networks, no differently than they would in an on-site data center.

**Example:**
If you forgot to update the security patches on your EC2 Instances and you get hacked--this is your responsibility.
