# AWS
Each markdown file in _notes_ contains my notes on a particular AWS topic. These notes were primarily created through my training with A Cloud Guru, but other resources may have been used or linked in my notes. My goal is to earn the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification, and ultimately the AWS Solutions Architect (Associate) Certification.

## Resources
* [A Cloud Guru](https://learn.acloud.guru/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/dashboard)
  * A 7-day free trial; includes online videos (lecture & hands-on), quizzes, and an exam simulator
* [Amazon Whitepapers](https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/)
  * Whitepapers I read in preparation for the exam are located in the _whitepapers_ folder
* [AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials](https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/cloud-practitioner-essentials/)
